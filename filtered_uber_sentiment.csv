User_155,,Two words: [cheap] grocery delivery! Glad I checked Uber on a whim one day while I was in a Lyft and found it's really expanded what it is. Definitely not what it was 10 years ago. (An expensive ride request app.) They roll out offers all the time. My grocery pick up from my local store costs about $6 which is awesome when I need my items asap and can't get immediate delivery from store. I plan to try more of what they offer.

Lyft is the exact same service but cheaper even without the extremely helpful price lock system. I still use uber occasionally, but I'm beginning to trust lyft to provide the same service for 40% less the price. The gouging on surge prices uber uses is just, it's just absurd. It's far more expensive on average in a city, and even rural trips are just more without surge. Uber is joke.",1,0,4.550.10001,2024-11-30 11:50:52,,,4.550.10001,0.7249,positive

User_10683,,Uber shuttle Driver did not stop at the location and despite calling him there was no response. Firstly the bus was late and then he drives past without stopping or even picking the call. Understand that you are offering a promotional free ride but doesn't count if the service is not serving the purpose. I wasted 30 min and had to make expensive travel arrangement to reach on time for another meeting. Poor service from Uber.
